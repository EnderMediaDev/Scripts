Welcome to the sheer glory of my server generation script.

Requirements to use:
- Technic Launcher
- Pack installed for each server you want to generate
- Client mod .jar's with a -client.jar at the end instead of just .jar.
    Example, clientonlymod.jar => clientonlymod-client.jar
- A decent knoweldge of shell scripts when something inevitably breaks because I suck :P
